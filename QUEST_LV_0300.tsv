QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000092	Seeing as there was no effect on Svitrigaila when he ate the poisonous herbs, it must be that he needs to mix them with holy water first, and then eat them to get the desired result. Find the Cleric Master and get the holy water from him.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000102	According to Svitrigaila, you need to amplify the power of the explosive powder in order to destroy the next terminal, and for that, you'll need to scrape off and collect particles from petrified objects in this area.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000103	Blow Up the Terminal
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000104	Use the explosive powder Svitrigaila gave you and the petrification particles you collected to blow up the second terminal.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000124	Thank you. Let me try eating these one by one...

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000130	I will never involve myself in a demon's work.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000131	I see... I should have expected that...{nl}I was a fool to hope otherwise.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000132	If it comes down this, I guess I'll have to try that method now.{nl}Destroying the Soul Compactor that's here...{nl}The beings that sent me here told me.{nl}{nl}The Soul Compactor and I are one and the same. Why didn't I remember this until now?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000133	Somewhere in this area is a Soul Compactor that absorbs human souls.{nl}It condenses their energy and uses it.{nl}This is a really suitable location for the Soul Compactor because, {nl}even after the Stone Frost blew through, it's still bustling with the activity of the {nl}Knights of Kaliss, grave robbers, and the soldiers of the Royal Army.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000134	{nl}{nl}If I think about it, the beings that sent me here must have linked my life with the Soul Compactor so that I could collect souls for them forever. So if the Soul Compactor is destroyed, wouldn't I die with it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000135	The Soul Compactor has 3 terminals from which it absorbs souls.{nl}That bad feeling you had earlier was also a terminal trying to absorb your soul.{nl}For now, try to wipe out those terminals.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000136	{nl}If you succeed in destroying a terminal, you should be able to retrieve its core.{nl}You need to collect those cores to craft an orb that will help you destroy the Soul Compactor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000137	Good job. This core will be used to make an orb that will overload the mainframe of the Soul Compactor.{nl}Now I can feel my death drawing near.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000138	Try blowing up the second terminal.{nl}Here, I'll give you some explosives, but you'll need to scrape off some particles from petrified objects in this area to amplify the power of the explosives.{nl}Since the Stone Frost blows through here often, there are plenty of petrified objects everywhere.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000139	Again, you'll need to retrieve the core from this terminal too.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000140	Now there's only one terminal left.. I feel myself getting weaker..{nl}The last terminal is probably short-circuiting.{nl}Try getting cores from petrified monsters in the area and throwing them at the terminal.{nl}That should be enough to make it collapse.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000141	And of course, bring back the core from the last terminal.{nl}Condensed souls are concentrated within those cores.. We just need to use them to craft an orb that will overload the Soul Compactor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000142	Now you've collected them all. Here, I'll give you the manual.{nl}Use this to craft the orb to overload the Soul Compactor.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000143	Just I want to rest..

QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000182	As to the words of the kingdom soldier, Retia, let's look for the soldiers who had been dispatched to the fortress at the shore. If they got into an accident, please collect their keepstakes. The monsters might have taken them so it would be good to hunt for the monsters at the coastal fortress.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000183	Return to the soldier, Retia
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000184	The soldiers, unfortunately died. You've collected their corpses so go back to Retia.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000185	Since you've collected all the corpses of the soldiers who've left to the fortress of the coast to fix the detector, it seems that you would be able to obtain some parts of the detector from Retia. Talk with her.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000213	I am guiding the spirits that were suffered by the petrified frosts long ago.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000214	But, this petrified frost is the curse of the demon king, Gesti..{nl}They make us Kupols into stones.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000215	We should at least find out when the petrified frosts would blow.{nl}There are some petrification detectors which humans have left, but some seem to be broken.{nl}Can you help me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000216	The detector you saw seems to be working well.{nl}Please look at how other detectors are working.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000217	The petrified frosts turn everything into stones. Even spirits.{nl}We, Kupols are not exceptions.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000218	Ah, that's it.{nl}Two of them are broken.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000219	We better ask about the detector problem to the soldiers who had created the detector.{nl}I heard the person who has the name, Retia is the officer so we may receive some help from her.  
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000220	He is at the Berkuti square.{nl}The human matters can't be resolved by Kupols so we are counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000221	Are you talking about the problem at petrification detector at the coastal fortress.{nl}We are already aware of that. The problem can exist.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000222	By the way, it hasn't arrived yet? {nl}I've already dispatched the soldiers there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000223	I don't have a good feeling about this.{nl}Due to numerous monster attacks here, we don't have additional forces to send.{nl}Can I ask you to follow the soldiers who were dispatched for the repair?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000224	Maybe they had been attacked at the coastal fortress.{nl}But, they are the soldiers of the kingdom.  The dead bodies should be here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000225	The petrified frosts are reported frequently at the entrance of the coastal fortress so I think they will be around there.{nl}In case you find some corpses, please collect them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000226	I guess it was too late.{nl}Thanks for collecting the corpses.{nl}If you find the corpses, please collect them.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000228	I am counting on you to guide all spirits to the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000229	Lastly, there's some story that they want to tell to the revelator.{nl}You would want to know why humans are suffering from this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000230	The rumor that the petrified frosts are the sin of the revolt is just a made-up story.{nl}The curse has come after the revolt so they may well think so.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000231	But, no. {nl}Everything was their plot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000232	But, the one who broke it first were the demons.{nl}That is this petrified frost.. they died and their spirits have become stones.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000233	The demon king, Gesti brought the curse of the petrification on this land and the goddesses tried to save the humans.{nl}But, the demons asked us whether we have forgotten not to interfere with each other's matters and..{nl}

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000236	I am trying to save the spirits from now on.{nl}Since you fixed all the detectors, we would have to guide the spirits to eternal sleep.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000237	We will do our best to guide each and every one of them.{nl}I hope the goddesses bless you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000238	I guess you can't trust me since a demon like me is asking you a favor.{nl}But, look at me closely. It doesn't matter if you laugh at me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000239	I've tried my best to escape for hundreds of years continuously.{nl}But, the curse of the petrification is the power of the demon king. Endless depression is suffocating me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000240	
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000241	If you cooperate on my death, I will definitely remove your curse.{nl}I promise in the name of Giltine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000242	It doesn't matter what happens to my body.{nl}I just want to take some rest..
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000243	The poisonous plant that grows up there would be able to take my life away.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000244	I should pray that the poisonous plant of humans brings me the eternal sleep.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000245	Thanks. Now, I will pray for the end of my agonizing life.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000246	So nothing occurs as I expected.{nl}If that's the case.. We can't say we are in the distress. We just have to rely on the one that we want to eliminate.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000247	Please get the divine water to the one who follows the call of the goddesses.{nl}That sacred power would lead me to ad death.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000248	I heard Cleric Master handles that divine water.{nl}I don't know if he's gonna give to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000249	Are you talking about divine water?{nl}I am sorry, but may I ask you where you are going to use it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000250	There are demons who need the divine water?{nl}I am sorry, but I can't help you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000251	I am not going to be involved in your personal matter.{nl}No matter what the reasons are, I can't help demons' matters as a priest.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000252	As a priest, I can't cooperate on the tasks of the demons.{nl}I hope you understand this as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000253	So.. that's it.{nl}Maybe, we've expected something that we shouldn't expect.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000254	The people who I believed to be my colleagues betrayed me. {nl}Then, there is no reason for me to hold on to this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000255	The demon lord has ordered me to collect the spirits of humans that will be dedicated to the god.{nl}That's why we began working on creating the integrator which would collect the spirits.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000256	The process as smooth, but I was suffered by the petrified frosts.{nl}They laughed and told me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000257	That I will be the magic source of the integrator.{nl}How come I have forgotten it..
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000258	You must know by now.{nl}The curse that has been laid on the barrier stone.. we use humans to pull spirits from them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000259	The spirits that were pulled will be gathered to the integrator and dedicated to the god.{nl}The god.. it is like me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000260	The integrator is being protected by three barrier stones.{nl}Destroy the barrier stones down there and obtain the cores from them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000261	I will cast a spell on you so that you won't get cursed again.{nl}The integrator moves by swallowing my vitalities so it's easy. 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000262	The guys who have abondoned me and laughed at me can't be called our colleagues.{nl}I will get a revenge on them by killing them. I will make them regret that they treated me like a magic source.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000263	Well done. The death is coming.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000264	The next barrier stone is up there. {nl}We have to put in the great power at once. Like an explosion.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000265	Okay.. there was a grave robber among the ones who had been sacrificed.{nl}I tried to lead myself into a death using a bomb, but it was useless.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000266	We should not forget about the core of the barrier stone.{nl}To avoid being cursed again, I will cast a spell again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000267	How come I never thought about this.{nl}Maybe my loyalty has surpassed the fear of lonliness.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000268	The last barrier stone at the deep corner must be exploding by now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000269	As the monsters were being petrified, their last breathes were also solidified.. Throw those against barrier stones.{nl}They will gradually collapse.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000270	The core of the barrier stone is composed of the condensed spirits.{nl}We will make orbs by collecting those that would explode the integrator.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000271	I will put my last power onto the cores of barrier stones which you've collected.{nl}Pull out monsters' detonators with this and make an orb.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000272	Of course, I will give you a method to make the orb.{nl}The orb that would explode the integrator.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000273	And, please fulfill my last wish.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000276	Do you know the meaning of the name, Giltine.{nl}Her name means death. The only thing that I can rely on at the moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000277	I once thought that I don't care how I turn myself into if it's for the demons long ago.{nl}But, only petrified frosts were blowing to me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000278	It started to get solidified for hundreds of years.{nl}My name has been erased from everyone's head.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000279	Even if she doesn't bring me the eternal rest, it will be better than now.{nl}I just want to take some rest..
